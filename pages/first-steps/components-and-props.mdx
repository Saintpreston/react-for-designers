# Components && Props

Ok, well we know about JSX but as you saw from the codesandbox on the [previous page](./jsx/) there's *still* alot to cover. Where does jsx live? The answer is in

## Components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called ‚Äúprops‚Äù) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single ‚Äúprops‚Äù (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components ‚Äúfunction components‚Äù because they are literally JavaScript functions.

<Callout emoji="üö®"> JSX was initially written with an object oriented paradigm, meaning you may also encounter the components as classes (checkout the syntax below), we won't be going over this but just be aware that it exists. [Learn More](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) </Callout>

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Rendering a component

So we have our component, it's ready to accept some props but how do we mount it to the DOM?

Well when we write JSX we're working with the [Virtual Dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) which is part of the magic behind React. The Virtual DOM compares before and after "snapshots" of the component tree between state updates so that only relevant HTML is rerendered.

If we can think of and refer to the DOM as a tree, it makes sense that where it begins to orginate it known as the **root**

This is how we append something to the root.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const element = <Welcome name="Designer" />;
root.render(element); //or we could've done root.render(<Welcome name="Designer" />)
```

  **Bonus Challenge**
  Prove you understand Props by replacing "Designer" with your name. For example if you're John - get the sandbox below to render "Hello, John"
