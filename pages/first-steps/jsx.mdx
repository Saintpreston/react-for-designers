# JSX

TLDR; It's HTML in JavaScript. However there's some nuance that you should know about.

## What is JSX?

It is a syntax extension to JavaScript. Instead of HTML We use it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.


## Why JSX?

Imagine we design something and we need to add a list item whenever a user clicks a button.

Consider this block of code
```html
<button>Add Item</button>

<ul>
 <li>Item 1</li>
 <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
We should get something like this:
 <Image src="/jsx/simple-html.png" width={500} height={200}/> */


Now hopefully you've worked with [DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) in VanillaJs. To make this work we'd need to have something like the code below.

```js
const button = document.getElementsByTagName[0];

button.addEventListener("click", function addListItem(){
 /* logic to add list item */
})
```
This would live in an seperate .js file. But what if I told you with JSX... this is how we add the event.

```jsx
<button onClick={addListItem} >Add Item</button>
<ul>
 <li>Item 1</li>
 <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

This is one of the first concepts you should understand...under the hood - react is adding the event the old fashioned way, but because it allows us to be declarative. 

We can inject our JavaScript function right into the jsx using ``{}``


Infact what if I told you...we can make this even more concise by making our jsx a variable before. 

Play around with the code sandbox below...there's gonna be some stuff you don't understand yet but you should be able to pick out the relevant line.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/happy-oskar-rjhx8j?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow:'hidden'}}
 
     title="happy-oskar-rjhx8j"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
 
*Hint hint* it's line 11   
```jsx 
const renderList = list.map((n, i) => <li key={i}>Item {n}</li>);
```

This is a **very** common thing you'll do in React. Think about your vanilla js knowledge and get a refresher on [`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map);

For every element in our the list variable -> return the following jsx...and just as previously mentioned we can inject the current element with `{}`




## Styling JSX?

If you consider that React is just compiling our jsx down to standard HTML and JavaScript. You should be able to style it with regular CSS right. 

Well yes, you are right, you can even use [inline styling](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) similar to the way you would in regular HTML - however just like with regular HTMl - this isn't a best practice.

Chances are a FrontEnd Engineer is using a technology like a CSS preprocessor like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or CSS-in-JS library like [styled components](https://styled-components.com/).


One of my favorite ways to style a react app is using the simple and intuitive [CSS Modules](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/). This allows you to scope your css to a single component. 

I won't get into the nitty gritty of it now but the main caveat you have to remember in your JSX is that `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

To prevent confusing the compiler instead of writing 
```html
<button class="elevated"></button>
```

We write 
```jsx
<button className="elevated"></button>
```
