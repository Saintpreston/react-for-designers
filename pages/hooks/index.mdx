# Hooks
**Jargon Incoming‼️**

In programming, a hook is a place and usually an interface provided in packaged code that allows a programmer to insert customized programming. For example, a programmer might want to provide code that analyzed how often a particular logic path was taken within a program. Or a progammer might want to insert an additional capability. Typically, hooks are provided for a stated purpose and are documented for the programmer.

Let's simplify this:

I don't know how true this is but I learned that hooks were named because they grant a developer the ability to attach their own code (like bait) and **hook** into external functionality for a desired result.

There have been books written about the concepts surrounding the idea of hooking but frankly we don't need to get too in-depth here.
