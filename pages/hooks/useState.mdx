# `useState`

This is where the fun really begins.

You know what a hook is but - 

## When would I use a Hook?
If you write a function component and then realize you need to add some state and functionality to it like what we're going to do right now!

Let's come back to our last CodeSandbox.

I want to make it so that whenever I click a button it goes from saying Hello Designer - to Hello Developer.

Our state data is the name and our functionality is

Let's do this step by step.



We know that we need the useState hook. Lets be very clear that this hook is simply a method on the class `React`. i.e. we can invoke it by writing 
`React.useState`.

However a very common pattern is to use JavaScript [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) so let's write this at the top of our `index.js`
```jsx
import {useState} from "react"
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨"> Hooks can only be used in React Function components or in custom hooks. The React team strongly advises against nesting a hook call. [Learn More](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation).</Callout>

Now we want to invoke our hook so that we can make use of it.
`useState` returns an array with two elements when invoked:

```jsx
useState()[0] //returns an undefined state variable
useState()[1] //returns a function that's used to change the state between renders

//we can use javascript destructuring once more and do this in a single line
const [state, setState] = useState(0) /*whatever value this hook is invoked with 
will be the intial value for state */
console.log(state) // returns 0
```
