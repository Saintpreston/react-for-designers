# React for Designers


## What is this?

In this guide we take a surface level look at how to spin up a Prototype web app with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) as JavaScript library for simplifying UI development.

We'll begin by asking ourselves some prelimary questions like "What is a prototype(note to self: make this a link)" and with that shared fundamental knowledge we'll be able to fully explore the benefits of React as a Design and Prototyping tool.

Here's a look at what we're gonna build today: INSERT CODESANDBOX LINK

## What you need to know?

*  Basic HTML & CSS
*  Basic JavaScript concepts like:
    * Variables
    * Control flow 
    * Functions
    * ES6 Syntax
*  How to manuever a text editor, we'll be using an online editor called [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) but you can do this locally with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Why should you care?

Some immediate questions that may come to mind is "What seperates this from a regular React tutorial?" or "What exactly makes this React ***for designers?***"


Well...as a designer you likely don't care about the "under the hood" of how react works and would prefer a tutorial that cuts out the Engineer and Developer jargon. I'm going to do you a favor and cut the optimization and complex state fluff that a Front End would have to worry about.

"But can't I just use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to prototype? Why would I learn a whole library?"
