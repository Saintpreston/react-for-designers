# React for Designers


## What is this?

In this guide we take a surface level look at how to spin up a Prototype Web app with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) a JavaScript library for simplifying UI development.

We'll begin by asking ourselves some prelimary questions like "What is a prototype(note to self: make this a link)" and with that shared fundamental knowledge we'll be able to fully explore the benefits of React as a Design and Prototyping tool.

Here's a look at what we're gonna build today: INSERT CODESANDBOX LINK

## Why should you care?

Some immediate questions that may come to mind is "What seperates this from a regular React tutorial?" or "What exactly makes this React ***for designers?***"


Well...as a designer you likely don't care about the "under the hood" of how react works and would prefer a tutorial that cuts out the Engineer and Developer jargon. I'm going to do you a favor and cut the optimization and complex state fluff that a Front End would have to worry about.

"But can't I just use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to prototype? Why would I learn a whole library?"

We live in a fascinating time where we see Design and Development being merged. The handoff from Design to Engineers is no longer becoming a point of tension. 

New Job titles "Design Engineer/Technologist" and "UX Engineer" are becoming more popular.

Take a look at how [Google's UX Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al1MRo6v7xg) alternate between using code as a prototyping tool or writing something near production level.


## What you need to know?


If you're finally convinced, here's what you need to know:

*  Basic HTML & CSS
*  Basic JavaScript concepts [(preferably in ES6)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) like: Variables, Control flow, Functions

And that's it. Let's Begin
