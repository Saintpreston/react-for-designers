# Welcome to Goodbye

Now you know just enough React to do some pretty cool things. This is where we put everything we learned together to build a Phonebook Application.

The [starter file](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-for-designers-starter-66xq69) is here and I already took care of the configuration. If you get lost at any point feel free to return to the starter file or if you rather work backwards here is the [finished version](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-for-designers-si64oi?file=/src/App.js).
