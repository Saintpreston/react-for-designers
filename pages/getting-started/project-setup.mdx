# Setup

There are alot of ways to set up a React App. The most popular way that's also reccomended for beginners would be with (<abbr>CRA</abbr>) [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

However, this would require you to a package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Whilst I recomended looking into these if you intend to level of your developer chops. We'll stick to using CodeSandbox.
