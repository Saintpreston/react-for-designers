# Setup

There are alot of ways to set up a React App. The most popular way that's also reccomended for beginners would be with (<abbr>CRA</abbr>) [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

However, this would require you to a package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Whilst I recomended looking into these if you intend to level of your developer chops. We'll stick to using CodeSandbox.

  The CodeSandbox template that we'll be using is based on Create React App so you should be able to follow along locally if you choose
