# Design Systems

Design Systems are all the rage right now.


## What is a Design System?

A Design System, sometimes referred to as a Style Guide is a single source of truth for how things should look and feel within a product.

It can consist of Typographic Elements, UI components (buttons, cards, tables, etc), spacing units & layout guides [(see the 8pt grid system)](https://uxplanet.org/everything-you-should-know-about-8-point-grid-system-in-ux-design-b69cb945b18d), how to handle UI animation and much more.


One of the first popular open source design systems was [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) made public in the 1980's.



## Why do we need one?

Internally, a company creates an design system for scalability and consistency within their product suite. 

The primary benefit of design systems is their ability to replicate designs quickly by utilizing premade UI components and elements. Teams can continue to use the same elements over and over, reducing the need to reinvent the wheel and thus risking unintended inconsistency.

Explicitly written usage guidelines can also serve as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and engineers within the company. Design Systems allow work to be created and replicated quickly and at scale.

Recently there's been a trend with companies publicizing their design systems, allowing third parties to 
- Implement it into in their own applications 
- Get inspiration for their own design systems
- Ensure apps on an existing OS or platform look and feel consistent

As previously mentioned, recent times have given us many public design systems to go around.

Some of my personal favorites include:
- [Google's Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)
- [Atlassian's Design System](https://atlassian.design/)
- [Vercel's Geist](https://vercel.com/design/brands#vercel)
- [Stripe's Design System](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/design)

## Our Design System

That being said let's come up with our own design system for this project. 

You may feel like a project at this scale may not warrant one, but it's good to follow a structured work flow plus I'm going to show you one of the many ways to translate your design system into code and enforce consistency once we start writing React.

Feel free to poke around in the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/UUNfBcDdKEBiB3k3zqYOur/React-For-Designers--Public?node-id=0%3A1&t=5W89HK7iQramDOZx-1) for a closer look. I even challenge you to make a copy -> edit a few things to your taste -> and then build that later on.
